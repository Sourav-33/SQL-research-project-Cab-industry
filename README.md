Cab Industry Growth Analysis

Introduction
Welcome to the Cab Industry Growth Analysis project. This project is conducted by Sourav Mondal, a student at IVY Professional School. The focus is on exploring the growth patterns, trends, and insights within a U.S.-based cab industry dataset sourced from Kaggle.

Project Overview
This project involves:
•	Data Cleaning
•	Performing Analytical Queries
•	Presenting Findings
We aim to understand the cab industry market better for future investments through this research.

Dataset
The dataset consists of four tables with the following features and sizes: 
1.	Cities Table: US cities, population, and number of cab users. (Rows	:20, Columns : 3)
2.	Customers Table: Customer demographics linked by a unique identifier. (Rows	:49171, Columns : 4)
3.	Taxi Table: Details of transactions for two cab companies. (Rows	:359392, Columns : 7) 
4.	Transactions Table: Customer transactions and payment modes. (Rows	:440098, Columns : 3)

Research Objectives
The analysis is driven by the following research questions:
1.	Variation of income per month among different customer segments.
2.	Most common payment mode used by customers.
3.	Cities with the highest and lowest number of taxi transactions.
4.	Trends or patterns in taxi usage across different cities.
5.	Variation of price charged for taxi rides with distance traveled and city.
6.	Seasonal trends or patterns in taxi transactions.
7.	Comparison of companies in terms of the number of transactions and revenue generated.
8.	Trends or patterns in revenue and profit over time.

Methodology
1.	Database Creation: A database named project_taxi_dataset was created, and the tables were imported using the command prompt for efficiency.
2.	Data Cleaning: Ensured data completeness and accuracy. Converted the date column from text to date format.
3.	Analytical Queries: Used SQL queries to address the research questions.

Findings
1.	Income Variation: Males (21-30) earn the highest on average at $15,127/month, while females (61-70) earn $15,087/month.
2.	Payment Modes: Cards are preferred over cash, with both genders using cards approximately 60% of the time.
3.	City Transactions: New York City has the highest transactions (~99,885), while Pittsburgh has the lowest (1,313).
4.	Usage Trends: Usage is almost equal between genders. Higher-income individuals prefer personal cars over cabs.
5.	Price and Distance: A linear relationship between distance traveled and price charged. Higher demand in top cities leads to steeper price increases.
6.	Seasonal Trends: Transactions peak in November and December due to the holiday season.
7.	Company Comparison: Yellow cabs have more transactions and higher revenue than Pink cabs.
8.	Revenue and Profit: Revenue peaks in November and December, but profit remains constant, with a decreasing trend toward the year-end.

Visualization
Bar graphs, pie charts, and line charts were used to represent the data findings effectively.

Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the cab industry, helping understand market trends, customer preferences, and financial performance, aiding future investment decisions.
